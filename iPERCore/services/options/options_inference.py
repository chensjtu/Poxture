            Each src_input is "path?=path1,name?=name1,bg_path?=bg_path1". 
            It must contain 'path'. If 'name' and 'bg_path' are empty, they will be ignored.
            
            The 'path' could be an image path, a path of a directory contains source images, and a video path.
            
            The 'name' is the rename of this source input, if it is empty, we will ignore it, 
            and use the filename of the path.
            
            The 'bg_path' is the actual background path if provided, otherwise we will ignore it.

            The 'fps' is fps of the final outputs, if it is empty, we will set it as the default fps 25.
            
            The 'pose_fc' is the smooth factor of the temporal poses. The smaller of this value, the smoother of the 
            temporal poses. If it is empty, we will set it as the default 400. In the most cases, using the default
            400 is enough, and if you find the poses of the outputs are not stable, you can decrease this value.
            Otherwise, if you find the poses of the outputs are over stable, you can increase this value.
            
            The 'cam_fc' is the smooth factor of the temporal cameras (locations in the image space). The smaller of
            this value, the smoother of the locations in sequences. If it is empty, we will set it as the default 150.
